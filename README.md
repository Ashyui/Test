# uchiha itachi




uchiha itachi is a simple naruto solution to your group management needs and has become one of the most prominently kanged bots around telegram, purely weeab themed.


## Note:
Future updates on the code have been moved to a seperate repository that is now private and away from the toxic, ungrateful and cancerous marie community, we believe we have burned out blood enough for the leecher community that just wants to take, debate and laugh while bringing nothing progressive back to the repository, in lieu of the same we are now closed sourced. 

If you believe this is "illegal or is violating the GPLv3" license, I request you come to @OnePunchSupport on telegram WITH your lawyer to discuss the same.
Good day! 

## Support and Help:
We do not provide any support or help or take any questions or queries around this repo, if you want to deploy it you are on your own, learn to read or ask in some python dev group or stalkoverflow, the internet is your learning ground - but do NOT come our support group asking any help around the code or the repo, you will get immediately banned and just cussed at. 

We did not run this bot or this repo to feed every entititled user who demands our dedicated time and attention, we are tired of it and the horrible community around kangs.
